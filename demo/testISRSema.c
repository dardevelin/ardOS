	This program demonstrates the use of semaphores from within ISRs, in particular the use of the OSSuspendScheduler and OSResumeScheduler calls.
	
	It assumes that LEDs are connected to pins 6 and 9, and that a pushbutton has been connected to pull pin 2 high when pressed 
	The LED at pin 9 will flash at a rate of 4 times per second, while the LED at pin 6 will be toggled whenever you press the push button.
